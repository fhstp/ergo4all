  "upperArmGood": "Great! Your arm is staying low and close to your side, just like when you're holding a briefcase or grocery bag. This helps protect your shoulder and keeps it strong!",
  "upperArmMedium": "Sometimes your arm lifts a bit higher than it should, like you're reaching into a high cupboard. Try to keep it down more often, as if you're carrying something at your side. It’ll reduce shoulder strain.",
  "upperArmLow": "Uh-oh! Your arm is too high too often, almost like you're constantly waving or reaching overhead. That can wear out your shoulder. Try to lower it, like you're standing with your hands relaxed by your hips.",
  "lowerArmGood": "Awesome! Your arm is naturally straight and relaxed like when it's hanging loosely at your side or gently resting on a table. That’s great for staying comfortable and avoiding unnecessary tension!",
  "lowerArmMedium": "Your arm sometimes bends too much, like you’re flexing or holding a heavy bag close. Try easing into a more neutral position, like resting your arm on a desk.",
  "lowerArmLow": "Oops! Your arm is staying overly bent for too long, almost like you’re holding a phone close to your chest. Try letting it extend a bit more, like when your arm hangs loosely at your side.",

  "trunkLow": "Oh no! You’re leaning too much, almost like you're slouched on a couch or about to tip forward. That puts strain on your back. Aim for a posture like you're ready to give a presentation balanced and upright.",
  "neckGood": "Yay! Your head and neck are in great alignment like it's resting steadily on a pillar. This supports your spine and reduces neck tension. Keep it going!",
  "neckMedium": "Sometimes you tilt your head too far up or down like looking at your phone or ceiling light. Try to hold your head level, like you're watching something at eye height.",
  "neckLow": "Oops! Your neck is bent too often, like you’re constantly looking down at your phone or craning up at a ceiling light. This can put a lot of strain on your neck. Try to keep your head level, like you're walking confidently and looking straight ahead.",
  "legsGood": "Great! Your legs are positioned comfortably and evenly, like you're seated at a desk or dining table. That supports blood flow and reduces pressure.",
