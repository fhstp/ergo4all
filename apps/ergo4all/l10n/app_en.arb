That's because feeling a muscle work isn't the same as it being at risk - risk depends on posture, performed activities, load, and how often you repeat the movement.\nThis app helps you spot patterns that could cause problems if repeated too often, so you can fix them before they do.\n👉 For tips on better posture and movement, check the \"Tipps screen\".",
